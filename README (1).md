🤖 NLP Task 3 – AI Chatbot Using NLP

🧠 About the Task
This project is part of CodTech Internship Task 3: building an AI-based chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
The chatbot responds to user queries in a conversational way using a simple knowledge base and machine learning logic.

🧰 Technologies Used
spaCy – for NLP (tokenization, text preprocessing)
TfidfVectorizer – to convert text into vector form
Cosine Similarity – to compare user input with known questions and find the most relevant response

📥 Input
The user types general queries through the terminal, for example:
AI full form.
Tell me a joke.
How are you??
Bye

⚙️ How It Works
Loads a set of basic questions and answers (corpus)
Accepts user input from the command line
Uses TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity to find the best matching question
Responds with the most relevant answer from the knowledge base
Saves the entire conversation to a file called chat_log.txt
(acts like a chat history or screenshot)

▶️ How to Run
✅ Make sure you have Python installed
✅ Install the required libraries:
✅ Run the chatbot:

📄 Output
Terminal-based chatbot that gives intelligent responses
Automatically logs all conversation to chat_log.txt for future reference
